Streamline your IPTV experience by consolidating multiple M3U playlists into a single source with the blazingly fast üî• and lightweight M3U Stream Merger Proxy. This service acts as a modern HTTP proxy server, effortlessly merging and streaming content from various M3U sources.

Uses the channel title or `tvg-name` (as fallback) to merge multiple identical channels into one. This is not an xTeVe/Threadfin replacement but is often used with it.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All versions after `0.10.0` will require an external Redis/Valkey instance. The SQLite database within the data folder will not be used going forward. For data persistence, refer to the [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/) docs. The sample `docker-compose.yml` below has also been modified to include Redis.
> To see the README of a specific version, navigate to the specific tag of the desired version (e.g. [`0.10.0`](https://github.com/sonroyaalmerol/m3u-stream-merger-proxy/tree/0.10.0)).

## How It Works

1. **Initialization and M3U Playlist Consolidation:**
   - The service loads M3U playlists from specified URLs, consolidating streams into `/playlist.m3u`.
   - The consolidation process merges streams based on their names and saves them in a database.
   - Each unique stream name aggregates corresponding URLs into the consolidated playlist.

2. **HTTP Endpoints:**
   - **Playlist Endpoint (`/playlist.m3u`):**
     - Access the merged M3U playlist containing streams from different sources.

   - **Stream Endpoint (`/stream/{streamID}.{fileExt}`):**
     - Request video streams for specific stream IDs.

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - The service employs load balancing by cycling through available stream URLs.
   - Users can set max concurrency per stream URLs for optimized performance.

4. **Periodic Updates:**
   - Refreshes M3U playlists at specified intervals (cron schedule syntax) to ensure up-to-date stream information.
   - Updates run in the background with no downtime.

5. **Proxy Functionality:**
   - Abstracts complexity for clients, allowing interaction with a single endpoint.
   - Aggregates streams behind the scenes for a seamless user experience.

6. **Customization:**
   - Modify M3U URLs, update intervals, and other configurations in the `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.
- M3U URLs containing a playlist of video streams.

## Docker Compose

Deploy with ease using the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml

version: '3'
services:
  m3u-stream-merger-proxy:
    image: sonroyaalmerol/m3u-stream-merger-proxy:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Toronto
      - REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379
      - SYNC_ON_BOOT=true
      - SYNC_CRON=0 0 * * *
      - M3U_URL_1=https://iptvprovider1.com/playlist.m3u
      - M3U_MAX_CONCURRENCY_1=2
      - M3U_URL_2=https://iptvprovider2.com/playlist.m3u
      - M3U_MAX_CONCURRENCY_2=1
      - M3U_URL_X=
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "redis-cli ping | grep PONG"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 5
    # Redis persistence is OPTIONAL. This will allow you to reuse the database across restarts.
    # command: redis-server --save 60 1
    # volumes:
    #   - ./data:/data
```

Access the generated M3U playlist at `http://<server ip>:8080/playlist.m3u`.
