> [!WARNING]  
> This repo is currently in heavy development. Expect major changes on every release until the first stable release, `1.0.0`.
> Using the `:dev` tag will allow you to be up-to-date with the main branch.

Streamline your IPTV experience by consolidating multiple M3U playlists into a single source with the blazingly fast 🔥 and lightweight M3U Stream Merger Proxy. This service acts as a modern HTTP proxy server, effortlessly merging and streaming content from various M3U sources.

Uses the channel title or `tvg-name` (as fallback) to merge multiple identical channels into one. This is not an xTeVe/Threadfin replacement but is often used with it.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Redis has been **removed** as a dependency starting `0.16.0`. The proxy should now be (mostly) **stateless**.
> Migrating to `0.16.0` is as easy as removing the Redis container from your compose file.
> Due to a major change on how data is being processed, any Redis persistence cannot be migrated over and a sync from the original M3U sources will be required.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization and M3U Playlist Consolidation:**
   - The service loads M3U playlists from specified URLs, consolidating streams into `/playlist.m3u`.
   - The consolidation process merges streams based on their names and saves them into one M3U file.
   - Each unique stream name aggregates corresponding URLs into the consolidated playlist.

2. **HTTP Endpoints:**
   - **Playlist Endpoint (`/playlist.m3u`):**
     - Access the merged M3U playlist containing streams from different sources.

   - **Stream Endpoint (`/p/{originalBasePath}/{streamToken}.{fileExt}`):**
     - Request video streams for specific stream IDs.
     - `originalBasePath`: Parsed from one of the original source. This is to prevent clients to miscategorize the stream due to a missing keyword (e.g. live, vod, etc.).
     - `streamToken`: An encoded string that contains the stream title and an array of the original stream URLs associated with the stream title. This token allows the proxy to be **stateless** as the M3U itself is the "database".
     - `fileExt`: Parsed file extension from one of the original source.

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - The service employs load balancing by cycling through available stream URLs.
   - Users can set max concurrency per stream URLs for optimized performance.

4. **Periodic Updates:**
   - Refreshes M3U playlists at specified intervals (cron schedule syntax) to ensure up-to-date stream information.
   - Updates run in the background with no downtime.

5. **Proxy Functionality:**
   - Abstracts complexity for clients, allowing interaction with a single endpoint.
   - Aggregates streams behind the scenes for a seamless user experience.

6. **Customization:**
   - Modify M3U URLs, update intervals, and other configurations in the `.env` file.

7. **Shared buffer without ffmpeg:**
   - Apps like xTeVe/Threadfin commonly uses third-party projects such as ffmpeg to consolidate connections for each channel. It does work well, but it adds up a lot of weight considering the size and complexity of ffmpeg. This proxy uses common patterns used by other stream proxies such as Nginx to distribute single input stream of data to multiple clients without any video encoding/decoding. See [here](#how-does-the-shared-buffer-work) for more information.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.
- M3U URLs containing a playlist of video streams.

## Docker Compose

Deploy with ease using the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml

services:
  m3u-stream-merger-proxy:
    image: sonroyaalmerol/m3u-stream-merger-proxy:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - BASE_URL=http://<server>:<port> # THIS IS REQUIRED
      - TZ=America/Toronto
      - SYNC_ON_BOOT=true
      - SYNC_CRON=0 0 * * *
      - M3U_URL_1=https://iptvprovider1.com/playlist.m3u
      - M3U_MAX_CONCURRENCY_1=2
      - M3U_URL_2=https://iptvprovider2.com/playlist.m3u
      - M3U_MAX_CONCURRENCY_2=1
      - M3U_URL_X=
    restart: always
    # [OPTIONAL] Cache persistence: This will allow you to reuse the M3U cache across container recreates.
    # volumes:
    #   - ./data:/m3u-proxy/data
```

Access the generated M3U playlist at `http://<server ip>:8080/playlist.m3u`.

## Environment Variable Configurations

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration list only applies to the latest release version.
> To see the README of a specific version, navigate to the specific tag of the desired version (e.g. [`0.10.0`](https://github.com/sonroyaalmerol/m3u-stream-merger-proxy/tree/0.10.0)).

> [!TIP]
> For variables needing Go regexp (regular expression) values, make sure to [build the regexp](https://regex101.com/) with the Golang flavor.
> If you only need to filter out a specific substring, then putting in the substring itself in those variables should work just fine.

### Playlist Output (`/playlist.m3u`) Configs
> [!NOTE]
> Filter configs (e.g. `INCLUDE_GROUPS_X`, `EXCLUDE_GROUPS_X`, `INCLUDE_TITLE_X`, `EXCLUDE_TITLE_X`) only applies **every sync** from source.
> Changes in the values will not reflect immediately unless the cache is cleared which forces the sync to trigger.
> Also, the `X` values on these env vars are **not associated** with the `X` values of the M3U URLs. They are simply a way for you to use multiple filters for each.

| ENV VAR                     | Description                                              | Default Value | Possible Values                                |

| CREDENTIALS | Set authentication credentials for the M3U playlist. Enabling this will require query variables in the M3U playlist URL to be authenticated.

You can add an optional expiry date at the end with another colon (:) as shown. Set to `none` or leave it empty to disable auth. |
| SORTING_KEY | Set tag to be used for sorting the stream list | title | tvg-id, tvg-chno, tvg-group, tvg-type, source |
| SORTING_DIRECTION | Set sorting direction based on `SORTING_KEY` | asc | asc, desc |

| SAFE_LOGS | Set if sensitive info are removed from logs. Always enable this if submitting a log publicly. | false    | true/false   |

## How does the shared buffer work?

The stream buffer system is essentially an implementation of a [Circular Buffer data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer).

Imagine a circular [sushi conveyor belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi) with a fixed number of plates (`BUFFER_CHUNK_NUM`). Each plate can hold a piece of sushi (chunk of data).

### The Chef (Writer)
At the preparation station, there's a chef who:
- Takes raw fish (stream data) and cuts it into bite-sized pieces (fixed to `1 MB`)
- Places each piece on an empty plate
- Puts the plate on the conveyor belt and moves to the next empty plate
- If something goes wrong with the fish (error), marks the plate with a warning flag

The chef works continuously unless:
- The restaurant closes (context cancelled)
- There are no more customers (client count drops to 0)
- They run out of fish (EOF)
- Something goes wrong in the kitchen (error)

### You, the Customers (Readers)
Customers sitting at different points around the belt:
- Remember which plate they last looked at
- Can look at all plates that have passed by since they last checked
- Make their own copy of each piece of sushi they want (copying the data)
- If they catch up to where the chef is currently placing plates, they wait
- If they see a plate with a warning flag (error), they know to stop eating

If a customer is too slow and takes too long to check a plate, the data might get replaced by the time they look again (buffer overwrite)

This system ensures that streaming data (sushi) flows smoothly from the source (kitchen) to multiple consumers (customers) while efficiently managing memory (plates) and handling errors (food safety warnings).
